  <!-- The Reference tag is basically a "do not execute" tag. It is meant to be used to hold tags only meant for references within the profile
        No tags within this tag will be executed directly. Only when used via the RefTag="Name" semantic.

    MoveTo Argument Reference:
      RefName (optional)              - Available for all profile tags. Allows you to reference back to another element, and use it's arguments.
                                          Currently no way to "overwrite" specific arguments. This may be added later.
                
      X/Y/Z (required)                - The location of where the player should move to.
      MapId (optional)                - The ID of the map that this tag is valid for. If this
      CreatureId (optional)           - The Creature ID of a creature in the game that we should move towards (if it exists)
                                          This is useful for running up to NPCs and other interactable objects.
                                          The closest creature in range from the XYZ, matching the CreatureId defined is used.
      
      Range (optional) [Default: 5]   - When within a specific range, the character should stop moving. 
                                          If a matched CreatureId-based creature is found, this value is used as distance from creature
